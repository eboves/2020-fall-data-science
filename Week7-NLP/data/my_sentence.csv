Republicans in Pennsylvania asked the Supreme Court on Friday to block, a ballot receipt extension that would allow them to be counted if they are received within three days of Election Day, -- even if they do not have a legible postmark. The lawyers acknowledged in the brief that the Supreme Court was divided, 4-4 on an emergency stay request on the issue last week, with Chief Justice John Roberts siding with the liberals, to allow the extension. It takes five justices to grant the Republicans' request, making Barrett's vote critical in the new request. The GOP is now asking the justices to formally take up the case, put it on an expedited schedule and decide the issue before Election Day."
